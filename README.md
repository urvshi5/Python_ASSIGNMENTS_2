Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Description
This program prompts the user to enter an integer. It then uses the modulo operator (%) to determine if the number is divisible by 2. Based on the result, it prints a message indicating whether the number is "Even" or "Odd". The program also includes basic error handling to manage non-integer inputs.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

Description
This program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50, inclusive. It initializes a counter variable to zero, then uses a for loop with the range() function to iterate through the numbers. In each iteration, the current number is added to the total sum. Finally, it prints the result.
Functionality

Initializes a sum variable to 0.

Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50.

Accumulates the sum in each iteration.

Prints the final calculated sum.
